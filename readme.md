## Problem 1: Array Replacement

### Description:  
Given an array of integers, replace all occurrences of a specific element (`elementToReplace`) with another element (`subtractionElem`).

### Example:  
```js
inputArray = [1, 2, 1];
elementToReplace = 1;
subtractionElem = 3;
Output: [3, 2, 3]
```

## Problem 2: Sum of Numbers

1. **Sum of Two Numbers:**  
   Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.  
   - **Example:**  
     ```js
     param1 = 1, param2 = 2
     Output: 3
     ```

2. **Sum of All Numbers:**  
   Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers regardless of the number of parameters.  
   - **Hints:**  
     - Arithmetic Operators  
     - Rest Operators  
     - `forEach()`

## Problem 3: Add Border to Matrix

### Description:  
Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks (`*`) around it.

### Example:  
```js
picture = ["abc", "ded"];
Output: ["*****", "*abc*", "*ded*", "*****"]
```

## Problem 4: Almost Increasing Sequence

### Description:  
Given a sequence of integers in an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element.

### Example:  
```js
sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1];
Output: false

sequence = [1, 3, 5, 7];
Output: true
```

## Problem 5: Sum All Prime Numbers

### Description:  
Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.  
- A prime number is greater than one and has only two divisors: one and itself.

### Example:  
```js
sumAllPrime(10) should return 17
sumAllPrime(977) should return 73156
```

## Problem 6: Domain Type Identifier

### Description:  
GoDaddy offers multiple top-level domains (TLDs). Write a function to label the domain types as follows:
- `.com` â†’ "commercial"  
- `.org` â†’ "organization"  
- `.net` â†’ "network"  
- `.info` â†’ "information"

### Example:  
```js
domains = ["en.wiki.org", "codefighters.com", "happy.net", "code.info"];
Output: ["organization", "commercial", "network", "information"]
```

## Problem 7: Sum of Squares

### Description:  
Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of their squares.

### Example:  
```js
input = [1, 2, 3];
Output: 14   // (1Â² + 2Â² + 3Â² = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14)
```

## Problem 8: Two Sum

### Title: Two Sum  
### Description:  
Given an array of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`), return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
- Assume each input would have exactly one solution.  
- You may not use the same element twice.  
- Return the indices in any order.

### Example:  
```js
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
target = 9;
Output: [0, 1]   // nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```
