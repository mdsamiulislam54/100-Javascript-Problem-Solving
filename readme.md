# Problem-1....
# Give an array of integers, replace all the occurrences of elementToReplace with subtractionElem. 
#   example:   For inputArray = [1, 2, 1], elementToReplace = 1 and subtractionElem = 3, the output should be arrayReplace(inputArray, elementToReplace, substrationElem) = [3, 2, 3].

# .....................................................

# Problem-2....
# 1 Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers.
# 2 Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers regardless of # of params.
# example::
# For param1 = 1 and param2 = 2, the output should be add(param1, param2) = 3. 

# Hints::   Arithmetic (1)Operators (2)Rest Operators (3)forEach()

# .....................................................

# Problem-3....

# Give a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.
# Example::
# picture = [“abc”, “ded”]
# output:::
#  addBorder(picture) = [“*****”, “*abc*”, “*ded*”, “*****”]
# .....................................................

# Problem-4........
# Almost Increasing Sequence
# Give a sequence of integer to an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing not more than one element from the array.
# Example::
# For sequence = [ 1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be almostincreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
# For sequence = [ 1, 3, 5, 7 ], the output should be almostincreasingSequence(sequence) = true.
# You can remove 3 from the array to get a strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3]

# Problem-5........

# Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.
# A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

# The provided number may not be a prime
# Example :
# sumAllPrime(10) should return 17
# sumAllPrime(977) should return 73156

# Problem-6........
#  GoDaddy makes a lot of difference top-level domains available to its customers. A top level Domain is one that goes directly after the last dot (“.”) in the domain name for .com example.com, To help the users choose from available domains. GoDaddy is introducing a new feature that shows the type of the chosen top-level domain. You have to implement this feature. To begin with you want to write a function that labels the domains as “commercial”. “organization”,
#  Example:::::
# For domains = [“en.wiki.org”, “codefighters.com”, “happy.net”, “code.info”], 
# the output should be domainType(domains) = [“commercial”, “organization”, “network”,]
